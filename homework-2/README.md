# Machine Learning for Regression

### Dataset and Goal
Utilizing the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle, this [project](https://github.com/JasonDahl/mlzoomcamp-homework/blob/main/homework-2/02-ml-regression-homework.ipynb "View project notebook") aims to construct a regression model for predicting housing prices (column 'median_house_value'). The project primarily utilizes the Pandas and NumPy libraries along with matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.  The data contains essential features like longitude, latitude, housing characteristics, and median income, among others.  Model weights are determined by matrix inversion.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial steps involve loading the dataset and examining the 'median_house_value' variable. This exploration involves:
- Identifying missing values in the 'total_bedrooms' column.
- Analyzing the distribution of the 'population' variable.

### Data Preparation and Split
The dataset is filtered to include specific categories from the 'ocean_proximity' column and selected columns for modeling. The data is split into train, validation, and test sets in a 60%/20%/20% distribution.

### Model Evaluation: Handling Missing Values
Two approaches for handling missing values in 'total_bedrooms' are explored:
1. **Filling with 0**: Train and validate linear regression models.
2. **Imputing with the Mean**: Train and validate regression models using the mean for imputation.

Both methods yield similar RMSE scores for the validation set.

### Regularized Linear Regression
Different regularization values ('r') are tested, and their impact on the RMSE for the validation set is assessed. The model with 'r=0' performs marginally better.

### Model Stability Analysis Using Random Seeds
Multiple seed values are used for train/validation/test splits to understand their influence on model performance. The standard deviation of RMSE scores across different seeds is calculated, indicating the model's stability.

### Model Testing
The combined train and validation set is used to train a model with regularization ('r=0.001'), and its performance is evaluated on the test dataset. The RMSE on the test data is approximately 0.33.

## Conclusion

This exploration encapsulates pivotal data preparation techniques, encompassing missing value handling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation within the realm of regression analysis.
