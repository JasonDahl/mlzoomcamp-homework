### Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning

#### Dataset and Objective
The project utilizes the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle, aiming to create a regression model predicting 'median_house_value.' It applies Decision Trees and Random Forests to this end.

#### Libraries Utilized
The notebook employs pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data processing, model building, and evaluation. Additionally, it incorporates XGBoost for advanced ensemble learning.

#### Dataset Preparation
The data undergoes preprocessing, focusing on '<1H OCEAN' and 'INLAND' records, filling missing values with zeros, and transforming 'median_house_value' using a logarithm. Train-validation-test splits are performed using 'train_test_split,' and DictVectorizer converts dataframes to matrices.

#### Model Training
It starts with a Decision Tree Regressor and progresses to Random Forests. Key parameters include 'max_depth' and 'n_estimators.' The models are trained, predictions are made, and performance metrics like RMSE are evaluated.

#### Model Tuning and Evaluation
The notebook explores various values of 'n_estimators' and 'max_depth' for Random Forests, evaluating RMSE for each configuration. It determines the optimal 'n_estimators' value by analyzing RMSE changes.

#### Feature Importance
Tree-based models' feature importance is examined using 'feature_importances_' to understand the most influential features for prediction.

#### XGBoost Model and Tuning
XGBoost is installed and trained with different 'eta' values, tracking RMSE changes for model evaluation and tuning.

#### Conclusion
The project demonstrates the process of building regression models, focusing on Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost. It covers dataset preparation, model training, tuning, feature importance analysis, and XGBoost training, showcasing ensemble learning techniques' versatility for regression tasks.
