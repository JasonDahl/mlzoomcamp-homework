| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| [Model Deployment with Flask, Gunicorn, and Docker](https://github.com/JasonDahl/mlzoomcamp-homework/tree/main/homework-5 "View project") | Deployment & Machine Learning | Focused on deploying a pre-trained ML model using Flask and containerizing it with Docker. Created a web service incorporating a Scikit-Learn model for predicting credit probabilities for clients. Utilized Flask, Gunicorn, and Docker for deployment. | Pipenv, Scikit-Learn, Pickle, Flask, Gunicorn, Docker |
| [Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/JasonDahl/mlzoomcamp-homework/tree/main/homework-6 "View project") | Machine Learning & Regression Analysis | Analyzed the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle, focusing on predicting 'median_house_value.' Explored Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost for ensemble-based regression analysis. Implemented hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost |
| [Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras](https://github.com/JasonDahl/mlzoomcamp-homework/tree/main/homework-8 "View project") | Deep Learning & Computer Vision | Built an image classification model to differentiate between bees and wasps using TensorFlow and Keras. Leveraged the "Bee or Wasp?" dataset from Kaggle and implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification task. Explored data augmentation through image transformations. | numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras |
